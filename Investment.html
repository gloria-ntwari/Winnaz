        <h2>Value of the certificates</h2>
        <p>
          Our certificates are reviewed monthly and are adjusted based on
          important events, so that they always represent an up-to-date value.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the period from 2021 to 2024, the value of the certificates grew by
          an average of 24% per year. From 2028 onwards, we plan to pay out a
          dividend of 20% of the profit per year.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an investor, you benefit from unique advantages that grow as you
          purchase more certificates. The larger your investment, the more
